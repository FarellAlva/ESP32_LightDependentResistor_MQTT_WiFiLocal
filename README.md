Transmitting data from ESP32 to a monitoring and visualization system involves several key components and technologies. This project uses the ESP32 microcontroller to collect data and transmit it through the MQTT protocol. A Docker-based setup manages services like Node-Red, InfluxDB, and Grafana for data processing, storage, and visualization.
